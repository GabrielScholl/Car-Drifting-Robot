# Car-Drifting-Robot
Drifting a car is a sport and both an art and a science. This video explains the project better and the engineering challenges that I encountered along the way. https://youtu.be/VncY2vOvF1s 

To drift a vehicle, one must accelerate and put it sideways while moving. Then, one must counter-steer and make throttle and steering adjustments to keep the car in an unstable position. It's much like balancing a broomstick on its end, or controlling a hoverboard. Using PID controller logic, I was able to program a Python script that drifts a car inside a racing simulator complete with a robust physics engine.
